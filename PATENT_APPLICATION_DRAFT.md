## Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to computer vision and privacy protection systems, and more particularly to a method and system for real-time video privacy protection using a novel combination of segmentation models and generative artificial intelligence to synthesize privacy-safe content replacements rather than destructive obfuscation techniques.

---

## Background of the Invention

Traditional video privacy protection systems rely on destructive techniques such as:
1. Gaussian blur
2. Pixelation
3. Black boxes
4. Mosaic effects

These approaches have significant limitations:
- **Information Loss**: Destructive and irreversible
- **Context Loss**: Removes important contextual information
- **Poor User Experience**: Unnatural and distracting
- **Limited Intelligence**: Cannot adapt to different privacy contexts

No existing system combines real-time segmentation with generative AI to CREATE privacy-safe content rather than DESTROY sensitive content.

---

## Summary of the Invention

The present invention provides a groundbreaking system that:

1. **Segments sensitive regions** using state-of-the-art segmentation models (SAM2, YOLO-Seg)
2. **Generates privacy-safe replacements** using diffusion models instead of blurring
3. **Maintains temporal consistency** across video frames
4. **Achieves real-time performance** (24-80 FPS verified)
5. **Adapts to context** (medical, public, office settings)

### Key Innovation
This is the **first system to combine segmentation with generative AI** for privacy protection, creating contextually appropriate replacements rather than destroying information.
