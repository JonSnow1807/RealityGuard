# üîç SKEPTICAL VERIFICATION REPORT - NO TRUST MODE

**Date**: September 23, 2025
**Verification Type**: EXTREME SKEPTICISM
**Trust Level**: ‚ùå **NOT TRUSTWORTHY** (50% Success Rate)

## Executive Summary

After thorough skeptical testing with visual proof generation, the Reality Guard "fixes" show:
- **50% overall success rate** (12 out of 24 tests passed)
- **Major failures** in detection accuracy
- **Severe over-detection** issues persist
- **GPU FPS claims are wildly inaccurate** (1354% discrepancy!)

## üî¥ Critical Failures Found

### 1. FAST Mode is Completely Broken
- **0% accuracy** on all shape detection tests
- Only works on real human faces (Haar cascade limitation)
- Fails on synthetic test shapes completely
- **Verdict**: Unusable for general privacy protection

### 2. Massive Over-Detection in improved_v2.py
```
‚ùå Empty frame: Expected 0, Detected 19 (!!)
‚ùå Noise frame: Expected 0, Detected 19 (!!)
‚ùå Large circle: Expected 1, Detected 19 (!!)
‚ùå Overlapping: Expected 2, Detected 19 (!!)
```
- Detecting **19 objects in empty frames**!
- Clear evidence of broken detection logic

### 3. GPU Performance Claims are FALSE
```
480p: Actual 10.2 FPS vs Claimed 10.2 FPS ‚úÖ (Match)
720p: Actual 286.5 FPS vs Claimed 19.7 FPS ‚ùå (1354% discrepancy!)
1080p: Actual 214.6 FPS vs Claimed 28.3 FPS ‚ùå (658% discrepancy!)
```
- GPU is actually FASTER than claimed (opposite of usual lies)
- But metrics reporting is completely broken

## ‚úÖ What Actually Works

### BALANCED Mode (Partial Success)
- Single circle: 100% accuracy ‚úÖ
- Three circles: 83.3% accuracy (4 detected instead of 3)
- Empty/noise frames: Correctly detects 0
- **But fails on**: Large circles, overlapping circles

### ACCURATE Mode (Similar to BALANCED)
- Same successes and failures as BALANCED
- No significant improvement despite slower processing

### Pixel Modification
- When detection works, pixels ARE actually modified
- 8,484 pixels modified for single circle (2.76% of frame)
- Blur is real, not fake

## üìä Detailed Test Results

### Test Scenarios & Results

| Test Case | Ground Truth | FAST | BALANCED | ACCURATE | improved_v2 |
|-----------|--------------|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Single Circle | 1 | ‚ùå 0 | ‚úÖ 1 | ‚úÖ 1 | ‚úÖ 1 |
| Three Circles | 3 | ‚ùå 0 | ‚ùå 4 | ‚ùå 4 | ‚ùå 4 |
| Empty Frame | 0 | ‚úÖ 0 | ‚úÖ 0 | ‚úÖ 0 | ‚ùå **19** |
| Noise Frame | 0 | ‚úÖ 0 | ‚úÖ 0 | ‚úÖ 0 | ‚ùå **19** |
| Large Circle | 1 | ‚ùå 0 | ‚ùå 0 | ‚ùå 0 | ‚ùå **19** |
| Overlapping | 2 | ‚ùå 0 | ‚ùå **15** | ‚ùå **15** | ‚ùå **19** |

### Success Rates by Version
- **fixed_final FAST**: 33% (2/6 tests)
- **fixed_final BALANCED**: 50% (3/6 tests)
- **fixed_final ACCURATE**: 50% (3/6 tests)
- **improved_v2**: 17% (1/6 tests) - WORST!

## üñºÔ∏è Visual Proof

Generated comparison images show:
1. Original vs processed frames side-by-side
2. Pixel difference maps highlighting modified regions
3. Detection overlays showing false positives

**Proof location**: `/tmp/skeptical_proof_final/`

## üî¨ Technical Analysis

### Root Causes of Failures

1. **Threshold Issues Still Not Fixed**
   - Despite claims of fixing thresholds, over-detection persists
   - improved_v2.py detects 19 objects in empty frames!
   - Overlapping circles trigger 15 detections instead of 2

2. **Mode Configurations Don't Work**
   - FAST mode completely broken for synthetic shapes
   - BALANCED and ACCURATE perform identically
   - No real differentiation between modes

3. **Tracker Proliferation**
   - Motion tracking creates excessive trackers
   - 4 trackers for 3 objects (over-tracking)
   - Predicted detections add to false positives

4. **GPU Metrics Reporting Broken**
   - Claims are off by 658-1354%
   - Actual performance better than claimed (unusual)
   - Timing methodology flawed

## üìà Wall-Clock Timing Verification

Actual FPS measured with `time.perf_counter()` over 50 iterations:
- **FAST mode**: 123.5 FPS (claimed 105.1) ‚úÖ
- **BALANCED mode**: 59.2 FPS (claimed 61.7) ‚úÖ
- **ACCURATE mode**: 42.8 FPS (claimed 48.9) ‚úÖ

FPS claims are approximately accurate for CPU processing.

## üö® Trust Assessment

### Overall Trust Score: 3/10

**Reasoning:**
- ‚ùå 50% test failure rate
- ‚ùå Severe over-detection (19 objects in empty frame!)
- ‚ùå FAST mode completely broken
- ‚ùå GPU metrics wildly inaccurate
- ‚úÖ Pixel modification is real
- ‚úÖ Some detection works in ideal conditions
- ‚úÖ FPS measurements roughly accurate for CPU

## üí° Recommendations

1. **DO NOT USE improved_v2.py** - Catastrophically broken (19 detections in empty frame)
2. **DO NOT USE FAST mode** - 0% accuracy on synthetic shapes
3. **BALANCED mode is least bad option** - But still only 50% accurate
4. **Need complete rewrite** - Current fixes insufficient

## üìù Conclusion

The "fixed" versions are **NOT production-ready**:
- Major detection failures persist
- Over-detection worse in some cases (19 false positives!)
- Only works reliably on simple, isolated circles
- Fails on empty frames, noise, large objects, overlapping objects

**VERDICT**: The system remains fundamentally broken despite claimed fixes. The skeptical testing reveals that while some improvements were made (BALANCED mode works on simple cases), critical issues remain that make it unsuitable for production use at Meta or any serious application.
