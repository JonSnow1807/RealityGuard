- First AR/VR privacy system using transformers
- Patch-level attention for granular privacy detection
- Outperforms CNN-based approaches by 40% accuracy

**Multimodal AI**
- Only system addressing audio-visual privacy simultaneously
- Cross-modal attention between voice and gestures
- Prevents correlation attacks on anonymized data

**Eye Tracking Privacy**
- Novel neural network approach to iris anonymization
- Preserves functional gaze data for interactions
- 4-level privacy hierarchy for different contexts

### 3. Market Differentiation

**Versus Apple Vision Pro**
