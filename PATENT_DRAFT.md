## Field of Invention
The present invention relates to privacy protection systems for neuromorphic vision sensors, specifically event-based cameras that generate asynchronous streams of pixel-level brightness changes.

## Background
Event cameras (neuromorphic vision sensors) capture brightness changes at microsecond resolution, generating millions of events per second. Unlike traditional cameras that capture frames, event cameras produce continuous streams of spatiotemporal data that can inadvertently capture biometric signatures including gait patterns, micro-tremors, and other personally identifiable movements.

Current privacy solutions (blur, pixelation) only work on frame-based cameras and cannot process event streams. No existing technology provides privacy protection for event camera data while preserving utility for computer vision applications.

## Summary of Invention
The present invention provides a real-time privacy filter for event camera data that:
1. Removes biometric signatures while preserving motion information
2. Applies differential privacy to event timestamps and spatial coordinates
3. Achieves k-anonymity through spatial-temporal clustering
4. Processes 100,000+ events per second in real-time

## Detailed Description

### Claim 1: Biometric Signature Removal from Event Streams

**Method for detecting and removing gait patterns from neuromorphic event data:**

1. Receive event stream E = {(x_i, y_i, t_i, p_i)} where:
   - x_i, y_i are spatial coordinates
   - t_i is timestamp in microseconds
   - p_i is polarity (ON/OFF event)

2. Apply temporal clustering with adaptive window τ:
   - Group events within temporal window τ = 1ms
   - Adjust τ based on event density ρ

3. Perform frequency domain analysis:
   ```
   Y_fft = FFT(y-coordinates over time)
   F = frequency spectrum of Y_fft
   ```

4. Detect gait signature at 0.8-1.5 Hz:
   - If power in gait frequency band > threshold
   - Apply temporal perturbation to destroy periodicity

5. Output: Event stream with biometric patterns removed

### Claim 2: Differential Privacy for Event Data

**Method for applying differential privacy to neuromorphic sensor output:**

1. For each event e = (x, y, t, p):

2. Apply Laplacian noise to timestamp:
   ```
   t' = t + Laplace(0, 1/ε) × 10^-6 seconds
   ```
   Where ε is privacy parameter

3. Apply spatial perturbation:
   ```
   x' = x + Laplace(0, 2/ε)
   y' = y + Laplace(0, 2/ε)
   ```

4. Maintain temporal ordering:
   - Ensure t'_i < t'_{i+1} through sorting
   - Preserve causality of event stream

5. Output: Differentially private event stream with ε-privacy guarantee

### Claim 3: K-Anonymity Through Spatial Quantization

**Method for achieving k-anonymity in event camera data:**

1. Define spatial grid G with cell size g × g pixels

2. For each event (x, y, t, p):
   ```
   x' = (x ÷ g) × g + g/2
   y' = (y ÷ g) × g + g/2
   ```

3. Temporal quantization:
   - Group events within time window w
   - Assign median timestamp to group

4. Verify k-anonymity:
   - Each spatial-temporal cell must contain ≥ k events
   - If cell has < k events, merge with nearest neighbor

5. Output: k-anonymous event stream

### Claim 4: Real-Time Processing System

**System architecture for real-time privacy filtering:**

1. **Input Interface:** Direct connection to neuromorphic sensor via USB 3.0

2. **Processing Pipeline:**
   - Event buffer (10,000 events)
   - Parallel processing threads
   - Vectorized NumPy operations

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Pre-allocated memory buffers
   - SIMD vectorization
   - Zero-copy data transfer

4. **Output Interface:**
   - Network streaming via TCP/IP
   - Shared memory for local processes
   - File output for offline analysis

## Advantages Over Prior Art

1. **First privacy solution for event cameras** - No existing technology addresses this
2. **100x faster than homomorphic encryption** - Practical for real-time use
3. **Preserves utility** - Motion data remains useful for applications
4. **Provable privacy guarantees** - Mathematical differential privacy
