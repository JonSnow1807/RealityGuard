# RealityGuard - Computer Vision Reality Check

## What This Repository Contains

This repository documents the complete journey of attempting to build a "revolutionary" computer vision system for Meta acquisition, discovering that most performance claims are inflated, and ultimately finding what actually works.

## The Reality

After extensive testing and multiple pivots:
- **Claimed**: 244-326 FPS revolutionary system worth $75M
- **Reality**: 85 FPS on GPU, 8-17 FPS on mobile, worth $1-3M
- **Lesson**: Every metric was inflated 3-10x

## What Actually Works

### ✅ YOLOv8 Pretrained Models
- Desktop: 85 FPS at HD
- Mobile: 15-20 FPS with heavy optimization
- Model: 13.2 MB ONNX
- **Status**: Production ready

### ⚠️ Event Camera Privacy
- Performance: 20K events/sec
- Competition: None (genuinely novel)
- **Status**: Needs special hardware

### ✅ Hybrid Edge-Cloud Architecture
- Edge: Fast but lower quality
- Cloud: High quality when needed
- **Status**: Practical and scalable

```

## Key Findings

1. **Pretrained models** are the only viable path
2. **Mobile performance** is 10-20% of GPU (not 30%)
3. **Preprocessing overhead** is 20-30% (always ignored)
4. **Real-time mobile** at HD is nearly impossible

## The Truth About Performance

| What We Claimed | What We Got | Reality Factor |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 326 FPS | 85 FPS | 26% |
| 244 FPS mobile | 8-17 FPS | 5% |
| 0.4 MB model | 13.2 MB | 3% |
| $75M value | $1-3M | 3% |

## Lessons Learned

Stop chasing impossible metrics. Build practical solutions with honest performance claims.

## Getting Started

For a working solution:
```bash
cd working/
python real_mobile_cv_system.py  # Uses YOLOv8 pretrained
```
